## ðŸ›  Development Workflow

### 1. Branch Naming

Create a new branch for your work.

Example:

```sh
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
```

### 2. Code Standards

- Write **clean, modular, and type-safe code**.
- Follow the existing coding patterns.
- Lint your code:
    ```sh
    pnpm lint
    ```
- Format also your code before committing:
    ```sh
    pnpm format
    ```

### 3. Commit Messages

Use **Conventional Commits** for all commit messages. This ensures consistency and clarity in the project history.

**Commit message format:**

```
type(scope): description
```

Examples:

- `feat(auth): add user login functionality`
- `fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

Common commit types:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation updates
- `style`: Code style changes (e.g., formatting)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
